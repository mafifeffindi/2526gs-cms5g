Elegant landing page theme with iPhone-like font, calm color schemes controlled via Customizer, and WooCommerce "Add to Cart" integration.

== Quick Start ==
1. Upload & activate the theme.
2. Create a page "Home".
3. Settings → Reading → Your homepage displays → A static page → Homepage: Home.
4. (Recommended) Install & activate WooCommerce. Add a few Products.
5. Customize → WebLabs Landing: set color scheme, hero texts, and WhatsApp number.

== Color Schemes ==
- Navy/Gold (Elegan)
- Moka (Hangat)
- Sage (Tenang)
- Dusk (Modern)

== Notes ==
- If WooCommerce is missing, the landing will show placeholders; add-to-cart requires WooCommerce.
- Replace images in /assets/img/ with your real photos.
